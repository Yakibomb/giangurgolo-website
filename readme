giangurgolo is one of the godfathers of the Lazy Shell Super Mario RPG Editor. Their website went down a long time ago, but I had a backup of all the documents on that website.

This repository is dedicated to host those lost documents from their website.

giangurgolo's website:

Old versions of the website can be viewed on the Internet Archive.
