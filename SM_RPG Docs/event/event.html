<h1>EVENTS</h1>
<h2>EVENT FIELDS</h2>
Event fields are mapped in a similar way to exit fields, and employ the same kind of data storing/reading to map them.<br>
<br>
Exit fields that are not encoded into the exit field data bank are most likely found in the event field data banks. This is because any other events that might occur at that exit field other than entering a new area are included with it.</td></tr>


At 20E000 - 20E3FF are event field pointers. They are located from the area byte.<br><br>
<table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="terrapinguards.gif"></td><td><pre>
20E40C - 20E414
0B 	music byte (Bowser's Castle)
C2 09 	pointer to area lighting entrance event
	09C2 AND $0FFF = 09C2
	09C2 x 2 = 1384, 1384 - 0C00 = 0784
	@ $1F0784 is D100
C1 89 	pointer to Terrapin guards event (byte 2, bit 07 - +1 unit span length)
	89C1 AND $0FFF = 09C1
	09C1 x 2 = 1382, 1382 - 0C00 = 0782
	@ $1F0782 is D0A4
8E 46	X,Y planar coordinates
E0 	upper bits / 2: height (0-7)
	lower bits: elevation
87 	upper bits: diagonal position (80 = up-left/down-right)
	lower bits: span width/length
</pre></td></tr><tr><td>
The blue prism is the event field, which engages in the code indicated by the event field map.<br><br>
The yellow point is the position of the field by the X,Y coordinates: 8E,46.<br>
The field spans 7 units from the coordinate, as set by the lower bits in 87 (although this picture is probably not graphically accurate).
</td><td>
<img src="terrapinguards2.gif" align=left>The default field position spans at an up-right diagonal from the coordinate, as seen here. This would be the field's position if 87 was 07; bit 7 of this byte turns the span diagonal down-right, as seen in the original field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><img src="terrapinguards3.gif" align=left>
Here the field's span width is only 2, the height is only 1, and the Z coordinate (elevation) is 1 (the green point is the original ground zero coordinate).<br>
<br>
The last two bytes would be 21 and 01.<br>
<br>
If C1 89 was C1 09, the last byte read would be E0, not 87. Bit 7 of 89 commands the code to store a byte setting a diagonal position and span length, so an extra byte is read. If the span length is only 1 (a single square coordinate) then the "diagonal position" is redundant and thus one less byte is read.<br>
<br>
A field with a width of one can still be set with the diagonal/width byte, but it is redundant and wastes byte space.

<img src="event_terrapinguards.gif" align=left><h2>EVENT CODE STRINGS</h2>
Event code strings very often call the SA-1 to handle heavy graphic sequences. SA-1 is mainly associated with graphics and animation. For the CPU to execute all of this code single-handedly would be far too cumbersome, and result in drastic slowdown.<br>
<br>
In event usage, it is concerned with object actions/interactions and other graphic modifications.<br>
<br>
Here is the event string for encoutering the two Terrapin guards in Bowser's Keep, Area 2.<br>
Code in blue is executed by the ordinary CPU. The code in red is executed by the SA-1 chip.<br>
This is how the code is actually executed as observed in the game, so that it can be illustrated vividly how a string of code executes different actions in an event. In a hex editor is in a very different order.

these set the two objects in the area to be modified, which are objects 1 and 3 (2 Terrapin guards)

set object sequence - this is the Terrapin "alert" or "surprised" animation

frame duration - sets the number of frames to wait while playing animation sequence

set object frame - shows the very first frame of object (Terrapin standing still) with no sequence playback

frame duration - sets the number of frames to wait while showing idle Terrapin

set sequence speed - this increases the "walking" animation speed by x2

set object sequence - Terrapin start walking

shift object down-left 24 pixels - the Terrapin move toward Mario

set object frame - shows the very first frame of object (Terrapin standing still) with no sequence playback

frame duration - sets the number of frames to wait while showing idle Terrapin

set sequence speed - this changes the speed back to normal

play sound - Terrapin attack (this only needs to be played once, so only one Terrapin needs to use it)

set object sequence - Terrapin swings his arm and attacks (only plays once)

frame duration - let sequence(s) play for several frames

set object code end - this means that any following code must wait until object 3 finishes its code

<h2>The Cross-Sectional Plane</h2>
<img src="plane.gif"><br>
<br>
26.6° , 63.8°<br>
<br>
The checkered floor of Booster Tower provides a good example of the 3-D cross-sectional plane grid. Each diagonal square is a coordinate: objects are mapped to points on the squares.<br>
<br>
A coordinate on the plane is a cube: it has an X,Y, and Z coordinate. Z is the distance of the coordinate from ground zero measured by units of 16 pixels (same for X and Y).
