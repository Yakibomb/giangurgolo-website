giangurgolo is one of the godfathers of the Lazy Shell Super Mario RPG Editor. Their website went down a long time ago, but I had a backup of all the documents on that website.

This repository is dedicated to hosting those lost documents.

giangurgolo's website:
http://home.comcast.net/~giangurgolo/smrpg/

Old versions of the website can be viewed on the Internet Archive.
