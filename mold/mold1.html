<br>
<img src="tile_example.gif"><br>
<br>
the top row of Goomba can be clearly seen in the first three tiles, which is the top row as arranged in the 24x24 size format<br>
<br>
the second row uses the 7th, 8th, and 9th tiles as seen in the editor<br>
<br>
Goomba's 17th, 18th, and 19th tiles are the last row, which can be seen directly below the 7th, 8th, and 9th tiles<br>
